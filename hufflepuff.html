            <h2>A Brief History of Hufflepuff</h2>
            <p class="history">Founded by Helga Hufflepuff to nurture students with the qualities of loyalty and fair play, Hufflepuff is often said to 
                take those who do not qualify for the other houses. This is, of course, a great disservice to the alumni of Hufflepuff and the current 
                students in it. There is no one as loyal or kind as a Hufflepuff. Making such a friend could be counted as a great achievement in life.</p>
            <p class="history">Helga was devoted to improving the lives of house-elves by employing them in the Hogwarts' kitchens and ensuring they 
                would not be abused. Her imaginative recipes are currently still used during Hogwarts' feasts to this day, to the delight of many. 
                Hufflepuff's common room is designed to resemble the house of the animal on their crest, a badger, by featuring cozy borrow-like rooms.</p>
            <p class="history">The members of house Hufflepuff who were most notable in the fight against Voldemort include the tragic Cedric Diggory, 
                who died after he and Harry Potter were kidnapped by the forces of Voldemort to resurrect his physical body and Cedric was believed to 
                have done his best at the time to protect his friend, Harry, and Nymphadora Tonks, wife of Remus Lupin,  who was tragically killed with 
                her husband during the Battle of Hogwarts. Nymphadora was a long-time ally of Harry Potter and assisted him and the wizard world by 
                battling Voldemort's forces on numerous occasions.</p>
