            <p class="history">Founded by Godric Gryffindor to show students their own bravery and chivalrous nature, some students placement in 
                Gryffindor were questioned at the time, but almost all of them proved their worth as a Gryffindor as they lived their lives. Godric was 
                a famed duelist and wielded both a wand and a sword. He left behind both his sword and his hat for the future generations of Gryffindors 
                at Hogwarts. The hat became the Sorting Hat enchanted by all the founders to determine the house a student was assigned to based on their 
                qualities. The sword, aptly known as the Sword of Gryffindor, could be summoned via the Sorting Hat by an individual that embodied the 
                qualities preferred by Godric.</p>
            <p class="history">The newest legend of Gryffindor, Harry Potter, is famous for many deeds during his years at Hogwarts. He exposed the 
                Chamber of Secrets, killing the basilisk plaguing the school, was the champion of the Triwizards Cup, and a leading figure who opposed 
                Dolores Umbridge during her attempted coup of Hogwarts. The most significant deed of Harry's was that during his final year at Hogwarts, 
                he went on a quest with his closest friends to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes, thus ensuring Voldemort could not rise again and cheat 
                death another time. While Harry takes most of the credit for the final death of Voldemort, it is important to note that four other 
                Gryffindors each destroyed a Horcrux: Albus Dumbledore, Ron Weasly, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom. While Dumbledore, Ron, and 
                Hermione had long proven to be true Gryffindors during their fight against Voldemort, Neville Longbottom's placement in Gryffindor was 
                questioned by some until his final year as he spearheaded the protection of students from Voldemort's forces inside Hogwarts while Harry 
                and his friends were on their quest. Neville proved his ultimate qualifications by becoming the second person in recent years to receive 
                the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat. </p>
            <p class="history">Perhaps because of the qualities Godric prized, there were no lack of Gryffindors in the fight against Voldemort and the 
                Battle of Hogwarts. Lily and James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, the entire Weasley clan, Rubeus Hagrid, and Minerva McGonagall are 
                just a tiny fraction of the Gryffindors who stood between the wizarding world and Voldemort's forces. Sadly, Lily and James Potter, 
                Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Fred Weasley, and Albus Dumbledore are just a few of the Gryffindors who lost their lives in the conflict.</p>
