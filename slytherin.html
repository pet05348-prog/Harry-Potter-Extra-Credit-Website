            <h2>A Brief History of Slytherin</h2>
            <p class="history">Founded by Salazar Slytherin in an attempt to cultivate wizards and witches to be sly and cunning, Slytherin has had a bit 
                of a checkered past. While Salazar began as a close friend of the other founders, he eventually broke away from the school after 
                disagreeing about how to enroll new students. Salazar felt only 'pure-blooded' students should be enrolled while the other founders 
                disagreed wholeheartedly with this view believing Muggle-born wizards were an asset to the wizarding world. An unverified rumor suggests 
                that the argument escalated to a duel before Salazar chose to leave Hogwarts.</p>
            <p class="history">Before leaving, Salazar left behind the Chamber of Secrets in an attempt to choose an heir to continue his goal of ridding 
                Hogwarts of all Muggle-born wizards. This decision began the tragedy that would become Voldemort.</p>
            <p class="history">While many not in Slytherin view Slytherins rather badly, there certainly have been Slytherin students and alumni who have 
                defied the stereotype believed by others. Severus Snape is the most famous in recent years due to his undercover work to deceive Voldemort and help to 
                cause Voldemort's final death, which Severus sacrificed his life for. An honorable mention must be made of the Slytherin student Vincent 
                Crabbe. While unintentional, he ended up destroying a Horcrux as well and provided another nail in the Dark Lord's coffin. Even Voldemort 
                himself must be mentioned here, as his final death would not have occurred if he had not used the Killing Curse on Harry Potter, thus 
                destroying his piece of soul that resided in Harry from when he tried to kill him as a child. There can be no better indication of the 
                redemption of Slytherin, however, than the fact that even Harry Potter's own son, Albus Potter, was placed in Slytherin recently.</p>
