            <h2>A Brief History of Ravenclaw</h2>
            <p class="history">Founded by Rowena Ravenclaw to seek out those with wit and intelligence, Ravenclaw remains one of the houses with the top 
                students. Rowena has a mysterious legend about her that claims she came up with the name Hogwarts after dreaming about a warty hog that 
                showed her to a cliff by a lake. The truth of this legend remains unverified to this day...</p>
            <p class="history">While Rowena prided herself on her wit and wisdom, her personal life was a bit tragic. Estranged from her daughter, 
                Helena, after her daughter stole a valuable enchanted diadem, the two fell out and did not speak to or see each other for years. Rowena 
                tried to summon her daughter on her deathbed, but she made a poor choice in her selection of messenger. Her messenger, long infatuated 
                with Helena, killed her after she rejected him. Rowena was rumored to have then passed away due to a broken heart.</p>
            <p class="history">Friends of Harry Potter himself, Luna Lovegood and Cho Chang are two notable recent Hogwarts alumni who participated in 
                the Battle of Hogwarts against Voldemort. Of course, no history of Ravenclaw is complete without mentioning the famous Gilderoy Lockhart. 
                Beloved by witches everywhere for his gallant deeds, Lockhart was even a beloved teacher of Harry Potter at Hogwarts for a year. His 
                recent memory loss has sadden the entire wizarding world and all pray for his swift recovery...</p>
